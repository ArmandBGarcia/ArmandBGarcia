I'm also studying a _Business Management_ **Engineering** for four years at the Technological Institute of Mexico.

Some of the Soft Skills that I've developed in Management Engineering were the next:

At <a>**Henry**</a> I did some projects that increased my skills, but just the two last projects were really quite a challenge.

As an Individual Project I had to make an Application Web using the next technologies:

- JavaScript
- CSS
- React
- Redux
- NodeJs
- Express
- Sequelize

Is a FullStack Web application and has different functionalities like filtering by alphabet, rating, DB or Api, Genres and it's implemented the CRUD of Database Postgres.

(if the information don't charge thats meaning that my free plan on railway were I have deployed the back expired)

As part of the final graduation project I had to make an E-commerce together with three more classmates, our e-commerce named <a href="https://animercce.vercel.app/" about="_blank">Animercce</a> deals with the purchase of Manga and Anime.

Contains local and google authentication and it has a payment gateway with **stripe**.

This E-commerce were implemented with the next technologies:

- **Sequelize**

I was working in the Backend programming the authentication funcions' as well as the frontend configuring Stripe library, I also worked with a lot of different routes made with Express and TypeScript and several Redux actions'.
